In the folder input_files there is subfolders based on suppliers names (Suppliername_cateogry) and in each folder there is 3 excel files: a DA file (DEMANDE D'ACHAT / PURCHASE ORDER ) and a SL file (SHOPPING LIST) and a catalogue file
my mission is to compare the DA with the SL and the catalogue based on every article's Item(Code Article) , Description and Price and output the results in an excel file as well
the code brings a basic interface with tkinter which lets you to choose the folder and the DA file and compare with a button Compare
